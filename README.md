hoops v2 - nba basketball game simulation

The project is my entry into using live data to feed into a simulation, and to use this data to calculate an end result. 
The idea is to eventually turn this into a graphical NBA Manager simulation game similar to 'Football Manager', 
given the large amount of player data that NBA has on games in the more recent seasons.

v1 - first release, used current roster PIE data per player, fuzzylogic
v2 relies on NBA PIE ratio for each team instead of per player, added offline caching of json files, MUCH faster execution
